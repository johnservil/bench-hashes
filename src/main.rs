/*
 * Every (contender, size) cell collects SAMPLE_ROUNDS samples of about
 * TARGET_SAMPLE_NS each (fewer for long cells: see LONG_HASH_NS). The two
 * knobs trade off differently:
 *
 * - Fewer rounds thin the evidence behind the min–max band, so the band can
 *   look tight while the true spread is wider: false precision.
 * - Shorter samples keep the sample count. Any disturbance (an interrupt, a
 *   clock step) is a larger share of a short sample, so it widens the band
 *   rather than averaging away inside it. The band then tells the truth
 *   about how noisy the run was.
 *
 * So the runtime budget goes to rounds first. 1 ms is long enough that the
 * clock's own resolution (tens of nanoseconds) is under 0.01% of a sample.
 *
 * Rounds cycle through the contender orders and rotate the point that
 * starts a round. A round count that is no multiple of the order count
 * or the point count leaves some orders or starting points used once more
 * than others; that imbalance is a fraction of a sample per cell, far
 * below the difference between two runs, so any count serves.

 * paths fill up (4-way NEON at 4 KiB, a sixteen-lane SME2 group at 16
 * KiB); above that the bulk rate settles. 3 KiB is where the fork's integer
 * + NEON hybrid kernels first overtake hardware SHA-256: one chunk on the
 * integer ALUs beside a NEON pair costs the same as the pair alone. SHA-1DC
 * and SHA-256 are block-serial and have only the per-message overhead to
 * show.
 *
 * The sizes past 1 MiB are there to show the plateau: a contender whose
 * 32, 64, and 128 MiB medians agree has levelled out. They matter most
 * for the multithreaded contenders, whose per-call overhead (a pool
 * hand-off, a subtree merge) takes longest to amortise: at 8 MiB the
 * fork's multithreaded rate was still climbing. Everything from 8 MiB up
 * is past the last-level cache on every machine this benchmark targets,
 * so the plateau is the memory-resident one. 3 MiB is to the plateau what
 * 3 KiB is to the SIMD ramp: a tree that is no power of two, whose left
 * subtree is 2 MiB and right 1 MiB, so a splitter that cuts at subtree
 * boundaries hands its threads unequal work there. 16 MiB was measured
 * and dropped: interpolated from 8 and 32 MiB, every contender's median
 * fell within the difference between two runs, on both machines.
 *
 * The streamed axis repeats the one-message sizes, each input fed to the
 * contender's incremental API (update, then finalize) in PIECE_LEN
 * pieces: below PIECE_LEN one update, above it one per piece, so the
 * implementation never sees the total up front.
 *
 * The many-messages axis counts 64-byte messages per batch, from one to
 * 262144 (16 MiB of input). Powers of two from 1 to 16 show a SIMD batch
 * filling up (the blake3 crate's hash_many takes four blocks at a time on
 * NEON, sixteen with AVX-512); 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 leave a group
 * partly filled or leave a remainder past the sixteen-message groups
 * ab-blake3 forms; from 64 up the per-batch overhead amortises, and the
 * batches past 16384 show the multithreaded batch calls levelling out.

/*
 * The duo measurement: two independent copies of a contender run at once,
 * each on its own thread over its own input, and the sample is the time
 * from a shared release to the later finish. A hash that takes the whole
 * machine to go faster alone runs beside a copy of itself here and shows
 * what that costs; a hash that leaves room finishes at its solo speed.
 * Every run measures duo; with --solo every sample interval takes a solo
 * sample and then a duo sample of the same batch, so each cell reports
 * both, side by side, from the same moment of the run.
 *
 * The two copy threads persist for the run. The caller posts a job, and
 * each copy takes it and polls a generation counter (yielding between
 * polls) until the caller has seen both arrive and flips it. Both copies
 * are then on a CPU, in the instruction stream, when the release happens,
 * and each reads the sample clock as its own first act; the later finish
 * is the later of the two finish times, each measured from that copy's
 * own start. A release through a barrier or condition variable would
 * instead need the operating system to wake a sleeping thread, which on a
 * busy machine can take hundreds of microseconds (a two-CPU virtual
 * machine measured 300 µs when the caller's own thread had just finished
 * a batch on that CPU); a copy that starts late finishes late through no
 * fault of the contender, and the pair's later finish would carry the
 * wake, not the hash. A polling copy needs no wake.
 *
 * The caller then sleeps on a condition variable until both copies have
 * finished. The finishes are sample-clock reads the copies take
 * themselves, so the caller's own wake, however slow, enters no sample;
 * and a sleeping caller holds no CPU, which matters on a machine with as
 * many CPUs as copies. Between jobs the copies sleep the same way, so an
 * idle run holds no CPU either.
 *
 * Reported per byte per copy: a duo sample over N bytes per copy is
 * divided by N, so the number reads as "the time one hash costs when
 * another runs beside it".
