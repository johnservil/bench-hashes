# bench-hashes

Written by GPT-5.6 Sol, Claude Fable 5, and Claude Opus 5.5 to my (Zooko's) specifications.

How fast is BLAKE3 on your computer, and how fast is SHA-256? bench-hashes
measures both, from 64-byte inputs to 128 MiB and in batches of many small
messages. It then draws the results as an interactive graph you open in a
web browser.

Results so far:

- [Apple M4 Max, macOS](https://johnservil.github.io/bench-hashes/benchmark-results/AppleM4Max.darwin25/bench-hashes.graph.svg)
- [A Linux VM on that Mac](https://johnservil.github.io/bench-hashes/benchmark-results/aarch64.linux618520virt/bench-hashes.graph.svg)
- [Apple M3 Ultra, macOS](https://johnservil.github.io/bench-hashes/benchmark-results/AppleM3Ultra.darwin25/bench-hashes.graph.svg)
  (a user's run of September 25, 2026, on an earlier version: fork
  b74b59e, bench-hashes d28326e)

## Run it on your computer

You need [Rust](https://rustup.rs) and a C compiler: Xcode's command-line
tools on macOS (`xcode-select --install`), gcc or clang on Linux, or the
Visual Studio C++ build tools on Windows. Then:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/johnservil/bench-hashes
cd bench-hashes
cargo run --release
```

The first build takes a minute or two. The run checks every hash against
known answers, then measures for a few minutes. The numbers come out most
accurate when nothing else busy runs on the computer meanwhile.

## Read your results

The run writes three files to `benchmark-results/`, in a folder named after
your CPU and operating system:

- `bench-hashes.graph.svg`: the graph. Open it in a web browser.
- `bench-hashes.result.txt`: the same numbers as text tables.
- `bench-hashes.samples.tsv`: every single measurement, for your own
  analysis.

The graph has six plots. The upper three show one hash on a single
thread of an idle machine. The lower three show two copies of a hash
running at once, as when two programs hash side by side. In each three,
the first plot hashes one input per call, from 64 B to 128 MiB. The
second hashes a batch of 64-byte messages per call. The third hashes the
same inputs as the first, handed over in 64 KiB pieces as a program
reading a file would, so the hash never learns the total size in
advance. Higher is faster.
Hover over a dot, or tap it, to compare every contender at that point.
Click a name at the right to show or hide that contender. The strip at
the top narrows every plot to part of its inputs: its band marks the part
shown, the arrows at its left end move where that part starts, the arrows
at its right end where it stops, and "all" shows everything. The strip
and the rate/time switch stay at the top of the window as you scroll.

At the bottom, the Provenance section says what was measured and on
what machine. Its Machine line also says whether the computer was quiet
during the run or busy with other programs. If it says busy, run again
when the computer is quieter: other programs slow the results down.

The contenders:

- **BLAKE3 servil mt**: [a fork](https://github.com/johnservil/BLAKE3) of
  the official BLAKE3 Rust crate, with extra kernels for Apple M4-class
  chips, spreading large inputs over all your CPU cores. On other CPUs it
  runs the official crate's kernels.
- **BLAKE3 servil st**: the same on one thread.
- **SHA-256** (the `sha2` crate) and **SHA-256 ring** (the `ring`
  crate): SHA-256 with the CPU's SHA-256 instructions where it has them.
  `sha2` is faster for the smallest inputs, `ring` from about 256 bytes.

## Share your results

Your graph is one self-contained file. Post it and `bench-hashes.result.txt`
anywhere people can download them: an issue, a gist, a forum. Anyone who
opens the graph in a browser sees it just as you do.

Or publish them on the web from your own copy of this repository, as the
results above are:

1. On GitHub, fork `johnservil/bench-hashes`. If you cloned it before
   forking, point your clone at your fork:
   `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOU/bench-hashes`
2. Commit your results and push them:
   ```sh
   git add benchmark-results
   git commit -m "Results for my computer"
   git push
   ```
3. On GitHub, in your fork's Settings, under Pages, choose "Deploy from a
   branch", the branch `main`, and the folder `/ (root)`.

A minute later your graph is at
`https://YOU.github.io/bench-hashes/benchmark-results/FOLDER/bench-hashes.graph.svg`,
where FOLDER is the folder the run created.

We would be glad to add your results to ours: once they are pushed to
your fork, open a pull request to `johnservil/bench-hashes` on GitHub.
Say in it what computer you ran on. Results from a machine we already
have go beside ours rather than over them: rename your folder first,
for example
`git mv benchmark-results/AppleM4Max.darwin25 benchmark-results/AppleM4Max.darwin25.yourname`.

## More

`cargo run --release -- --help` lists the other options, such as more
BLAKE3 and SHA implementations. [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md) explains
how bench-hashes measures, and what each contender runs.
