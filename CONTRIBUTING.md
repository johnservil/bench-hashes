# Working on bench-hashes

This file holds what you need to change bench-hashes, or the BLAKE3 fork
it measures, and keep your results comparable with ours.
[METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md) explains the measurement design.

## Layout

- `src/main.rs`: the whole benchmark (contenders, timing, statistics, the
  text report, the SVG and its script).
- `src/test_vectors.rs`: golden digests, written by
  `tools/gen-test-vectors.py`.
- `build.rs`: embeds the provenance (this repository's commit and state,
  and each contender crate's version and source).
- `tools/graph-check/`: drives the graph's script in jsdom and checks its
  layout (its README says how).
- `tools/check-report.py`: recomputes every table cell of a run's report
  from its samples, as exact fractions, and compares.

## Build and test

```sh
cargo test --release
cargo run --release -- --quick     # seconds; a full run takes minutes
node tools/graph-check/check.js benchmark-results/FOLDER/bench-hashes.graph.svg
python3 tools/check-report.py benchmark-results/FOLDER
```

## Working on the fork alongside

The BLAKE3 servil contenders (`blake3-servil-st`, `blake3-servil-mt`) use
the crate `blake3-servil`, a git dependency on the `servil` branch of
[github.com/johnservil/BLAKE3](https://github.com/johnservil/BLAKE3), at
the commit `Cargo.lock` pins. To measure your own checkout of the fork,
put this repository inside it and point the dependency there:

```sh
git clone --branch servil https://github.com/johnservil/BLAKE3
git clone https://github.com/johnservil/bench-hashes BLAKE3/bench-hashes
cd BLAKE3/bench-hashes
cargo --config 'patch."https://github.com/johnservil/BLAKE3".blake3-servil.path=".."' run --release
```

Cargo then rewrites `Cargo.lock`'s `blake3-servil` entry; restore it with
`git checkout Cargo.lock` before you commit. The build counts that one
change as clean, and the report names the fork checkout's commit and
whether its tree was clean. The fork's `CONTRIBUTING.md` covers the
fork's own tests and its performance-regression check, which runs this
benchmark.

`cargo update -p blake3-servil` moves the pin to the fork's newest
`servil` commit.

## Rules that keep results comparable

- **Contenders are black boxes.** The benchmark lists a contender, calls
  its plain entry point (single-threaded, multithreaded, a batch call, or
  its incremental API for a stream) with no pool, cap, or wrapper of its
  own, and asks the fork for its
  `kernel_report()`. A contender without a batch entry point hashes a
  batch as `for m in batch { hash(m) }`.
- **Expected digests come from independent implementations**: the BLAKE3
  reference implementation and Python's `hashlib`, through
  `tools/gen-test-vectors.py`. A new point needs its vectors there.
  Regenerating vectors is a reviewed change; tests never write their own
  expected answers.
- **Results name their code.** Commit before you publish a result: a
  report whose provenance says `dirty-…` measured uncommitted code.
- **The fork's regression check depends on this interface**:
  `--contenders`, `--points`, `--rounds`, and the columns of
  `bench-hashes.samples.tsv` (`contender`, `scenario`, `use_case`,
  `point`, `unit`, `ns/units`, each sample as measured).

## Results from other machines

Pull requests that add a machine's results are welcome: one folder under
`benchmark-results/`, the three files a run writes, from a clean commit
of this repository. A second machine of a kind we already have gets a
folder name of its own.

## Adding a contender

A contender is a variant of `Algorithm` in `src/main.rs`, with an entry
in `Algorithm::ALL`, a key, a name, a colour, a provenance string, a mode
description, a kernel description (`detect_kernels`), an arm in
`hash_batch`, and one in `hash_stream` (or `takes_part` false for the
streamed use case). The harness handles selection, interleaving, checking, and
reporting for any count from two to eight.

## Text in the graph and the report

The graph and the report are read by newcomers holding only the page as
well as by regulars: text in them uses words a newcomer knows or the page
introduces, describes the page as it is, and is computed from the run's
own data (it names only contenders the run has). Details go behind the
page's doors (tooltips, "How to read this graph", "About this run").
`AGENTS.md`, "Presentation: write each page for a reader who holds only
the page", has the whole practice. Check a change with
`node tools/graph-check/check.js` and by looking at a render.

## Maintainers' notes

`AGENTS.md`, `NEXT-STEPS.md`, and `NOTES.md` are the maintainers' working
notes: environment, current work, and the reasoning behind past
decisions. Contributing needs none of them; `NOTES.md` explains why the
measurement works as it does, should you want to change it.
